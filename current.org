**** solution

Needed to add correct relation


*** model not initalized

#+begin_src ruby :session strangler-console :output results
a = PromotionCode.new( code: SecureRandom.hex(3), use_limit: 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<PromotionCode id: nil, promotion_id: nil, code: "93b091", use_limit: 1, uses: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>

- Looks like the code was changed class
  - Yep, changed the PromotionCode  commit 8d748c

     ArgumentError:
       When assigning attributes, you must pass a hash as an argument.

   Failure/Error: let(:promo_code) { described_class.new(promotion) }
#+end_src


*** Solution
The model was using an improper initalization method.
The initalization method was deleted and the rails default was used

*** After fixing model by adding promotion using the rails way
#+begin_src quote
 ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch:
       Promotion(#70344446051980) expected, got #<InstanceDouble(Promotion) (anonymous)> which is an instance of RSpec::Mocks::InstanceVerifyingDouble(#70344509879160)
#+end_src

**** Solution
commit: [[https://github.com/1000Bulbs/strangler/pull/2036/commits/daa7594069219406bf241bae8960c867489990bb][9f5f2b]]

Use allow-receive pattern instead of using instance spies
